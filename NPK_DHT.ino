Farming faces problems due to climate change, like unpredictable weather and shifting growing seasons.
An advanced machine learning model is used to study soil history and local methods, recommending the       right crops.
This system considers things like temperature and humidity to give farmers useful info, dealing with climate change issues such as rainfall, temperature, and pests.
The technology helps make farming tougher and eco-friendly, leading to more food, less harm to the environment, and better lives for farmers facing climate issues.
